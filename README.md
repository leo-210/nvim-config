# LÃ©o-21's Nvim config

To install, simply copy all files in your `~/.config/nvim` folder on Linux.

## Todo :
- Add and configure the `which-key.nvim` plugin

## Things that might not work everywhere
- The custom `:EditSnippet` command, because it assumes the Nvim configuration 
is at `$HOME/.config/nvim` (you can change this in the `after/plugin/luasnip.lua` 
file
